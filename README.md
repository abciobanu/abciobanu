- 🔭 Undergraduate student, eager to explore and experiment. Interested in all things technology.
- 🎾 Follower of all sports, I enjoy talking day and night about any sport and the world around it.
- 🚲 Single-speed bike owner, I'd like to ride my bike more than I have lately (timeless fact, I always say it, I always make excuses).
- 🏔 I love everything about the mountains: the fresh, cold air, the nature, the scenery. Not surprisingly, winter is my favorite.
- 💬 I'm always delighted to meet new and genuine people and listen to their ambitions, beliefs and life stories.
